# Space Science with Python
This repository is part of a "Space Science with Python" tutorial series. The corresponding articles that explain each part are available on Medium (https://medium.com/@thomas.albin). If you do not have a Medium account, please visit my posts on Reddit, to get the free available Medium friend links (https://www.reddit.com/user/MrAstroThomas).

Each part will be stored in a sub-directory. Some folders have a generic purpose and will be used in several tutorials. Please comment on my Medium articles or write me via Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/user/MrAstroThomas) if you have any ideas (topics or improvement), if you want to provide some feedback or if you need additional information.

For all Twitter users who want to see recent updates in their feed: I just created a Twitter account where I will tweet the Medium friends link as well: https://twitter.com/MrAstroThomas
