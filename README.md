# Space Science with Python
This repository is part of a "Space Science with Python" tutorial series. The corresponding articles that explain each part are available on Medium (https://medium.com/@thomas.albin). If you do not have a Medium account, please visit my posts on Reddit, to get the free available Medium friend links (https://www.reddit.com/user/MrAstroThomas).

Each part will be stored in a sub-directory. Some folders have a generic purpose and will be used in several tutorials. Please comment on my Medium articles or write me via Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/user/MrAstroThomas) if you have any ideas (topics or improvement), if you want to provide some feedback or if you need additional information.
